#### **--- work ---**

I work in low-latency ("high-frequency") trading as a **quantitative researcher**,
which means I use math, statistics, and computers to study financial markets, build predictive signals, and improve trading strategies that go super fast.


#### **--- background ---**

I have a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison,
where I was a graduate affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu).
My graduate work focused on Bayesian + causal methods for studying U.S. elections and public opinion.


#### **--- lately ---**

Some things I have been interested in:

- Software design, especially functional programming
- Category theory, in service of functional programming
- Frequentist statistics, which isn't how I usually do things
- Neovim and [lua-based configuration](https://github.com/mikedecr/neovim-configs)
