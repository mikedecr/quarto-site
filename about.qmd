#### **--- work ---**

I work in low-latency trading as a **quantitative researcher**,
where I use mathematical models, statistics, and novel computational tools to design and study trading strategies that go very fast.

My work deals heavily with market "microstructure", which in plain English means, modern financial markets are rule-based systems built on hardware and software in physical computers, the design and capabilities of which have real consequences for trading on those systems.


#### **--- code + stats ---**

I write Python professionally as a quantitative researcher and developer of proprietary research software.
I maintain private interests in R, Julia, and (thanks to [Neovim...](https://github.com/mikedecr/neovim-configs)) Lua.
I've been curious about Haskell but wondering what to do with it.

On the statistics front, I am especially interested in Bayesian methods, causal inference, and where they can overlap.


#### **--- background ---**

I have a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison,
where I was a graduate affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu).
My graduate work focused on Bayesian and causal methods for studying U.S. elections and public opinion.
My dissertation built new Bayesian models to measure latent political ideology in congressional districts.
