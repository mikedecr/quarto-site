#### **--- work ---**

I work in low-latency trading as a **quantitative researcher**.
I use mathematical models, statistics, and novel computational tools to build trading strategies that go very fast.

My work deals heavily with "market microstructure", which in plain English means, modern financial markets are rule-based systems built on software and hardware in physical computers, the design and capabilities of those systems have real consequences for fast trading.

<!-- I write Python professionally as a research practitioner and as a developer of proprietary research software. -->
<!-- I maintain private interests in R and Julia. -->
<!-- I've been curious about Haskell and Lisps but wondering where to go with those. -->

<!-- On the statistics front, I am especially interested in Bayesian methods, causal inference, and where they can overlap. -->


#### **--- background ---**

I have a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison,
where I was a graduate affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu).
My graduate work focused on Bayesian and causal methods for studying U.S. elections and public opinion.
My dissertation built new Bayesian models to measure latent political ideology in congressional districts.
