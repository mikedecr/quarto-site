#### **--- work ---**

I work in low-latency ("high-frequency") trading as a **quantitative researcher**,
which means I use statistical modeling and novel computational tools to study financial markets, build predictive signals, and improve trading strategies that go super fast.

I am most interested in what we call "market microstructure", which in plain English means, financial markets have to be implemented as computational/physical systems
whose design and capabilities have real consequences for effective trading strategies.

#### **--- code + stats ---**

I write Python professionally, both as an applied researcher and as a developer of proprietary research software.
I maintain a private interest in R, which I learned in graduate school and come to appreciate more as I work in other languages.
I have budding interests in Lua (thanks to my Neovim [configuration adventures](https://github.com/mikedecr/neovim-configs)) and Julia.
My curiosities about functional programming and category theory have me interested in Haskell but wondering what to do with it.

On the statistics front, I am especially interested in Bayesian methods, causal inference, and where they can overlap.

#### **--- background ---**

I have a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison,
where I was a graduate affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu).
My graduate work focused on Bayesian and causal methods for studying U.S. elections and public opinion.
My dissertation built new Bayesian models to measure latent political ideology in congressional districts.
