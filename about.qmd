#### **---work---**

I work in low-latency finance as a **quantitative researcher**,
which means I use 

- mathematical models
- statistical analysis / machine learning
- state-of-the-art computing tools

to study markets, build predictive signals, and improve trading strategies that go very fast.

#### **---background---**

I have a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison,
where I was a graduate affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu).
My graduate work focused on Bayesian + causal models for studying U.S. elections and public opinion.


#### **---lately---**

Some things I have been interested in:

- Software design, functional programming especially
- Lua-flavored [Neovim](https://github.com/mikedecr/neovim-configs/tree/lua)
- Frequentist statistics
