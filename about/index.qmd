**I am a quantitative researcher** living in Chicago, IL.
I work in low-latency trading applying mathematical models, statistics, and novel computational tools to build trading strategies that go very fast.

**I used to be a social scientist.**
I finished my Ph.D. in political science from UWâ€“Madison in 2020.
My graduate work focused on Bayesian measurement models and causal methods for studying elections, public opinion, and partisan ideology in the United States.

I use this site to publish an occasional blog post about statistics or programming.
