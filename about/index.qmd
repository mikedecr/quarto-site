### -- work --

I work as a **quantitative researcher** at a low-latency trading firm.
I use mathematical models, statistics, and novel computational tools to build trading strategies that go very fast.
I work with market **microstructure**, which in plain English means, 

> Modern financial markets are rule-based systems built on software and hardware in physical computers.
> The designs and capabilities of these systems have meaningful consequences for fast and effective trading.

This work is quite secretive, though, so I will not be blogging about it.
Sorry!


### -- background --

I have a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I was a graduate affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu).
My graduate work focused on Bayesian measurement models and causal methods for studying elections, public opinion, and political ideology in the United States.

I write a lot of Python, Julia, and R, for work and for fun.
I am interested in programming languages as a general topic and functional programming in particular.
